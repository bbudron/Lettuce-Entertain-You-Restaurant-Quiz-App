# Lettuce-Entertain-You-Restaurant-Quiz-App
This is a React Native app built with TypeScript that lets users take a quiz to find out what restaurant they should visit. The app displays a series of questions with multiple choice answers, and at the end of the quiz, it calculates the user's score and suggests a restaurant based on their answers.
